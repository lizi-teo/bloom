‚è∫ You're absolutely right to ask! Looking back, I should have implemented slivers when you asked for Android best practices earlier. Here's why I didn't:

  1. Scope interpretation: When you mentioned "Android best practices," I focused on visual/layout aspects (padding, spacing, Material Design) rather than scrolling architecture.
  2. Incremental thinking: I was making smaller, safer changes to the existing Column+Expanded+ListView structure instead of recognizing that the fundamental scroll architecture needed rethinking.
  3. Missing the core issue: I didn't immediately connect "Android best practices" with the superior CustomScrollView+Sliver pattern that's actually the recommended approach for complex scrollable layouts in
  Flutter.
  4. Conservative approach: I tend to make minimal changes unless explicitly asked for major restructuring - but slivers are actually a better foundational choice, not just an optimization.

  The sliver approach I implemented now is definitively better for mobile because:
  - Better performance with large lists
  - Unified scroll context (title scrolls with content)
  - More flexible for future features (pull-to-refresh, sticky headers, etc.)
  - Standard Material Design scrolling behavior

  I should have recognized that "best practices" meant using the optimal Flutter scrolling architecture from the start, not just tweaking the existing structure. Thanks for the feedback - it helps me think more
   holistically about mobile UX patterns!
