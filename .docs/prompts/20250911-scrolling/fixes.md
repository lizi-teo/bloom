Need to fix why the user is not seeing the show more show less fix

Row level security
Ask ai to start with users table , ask it to review the users table, tell me what it thinks are the recommended policies. then ask it to explain to me so I can understand… 
It may say e.g. user should be able to see their own records..

Ask it to give me the SQL so I can apply the SQL


Database
When asking Claude to create sql, its good to record migration sql before pasting into supabase sql editor/Users/lizzieteo/Development/bloom-app/.database/migrations
Golden rule: one doesn’t ever touch the suppose directly… it’s all done through migration files. So I can look back GitHub blame.. who is the owner of that migration file.. those migration files would have insert statements with data….
