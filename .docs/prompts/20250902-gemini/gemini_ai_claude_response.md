Implementation Complete!

  I've successfully implemented the individual-then-aggregate sentiment analysis approach for your
  Bloom app. Here's what was delivered:

  ðŸ”§ Key Changes Made:

  1. Simplified SessionSentimentResult - Removed confusing dual scores, now returns single clear
  sentiment score
  2. Enhanced SentimentService.analyzeSessionSentiment() - Uses individual-then-aggregate approach:
    - Analyzes each open-ended response individually (0-100 score)
    - Calculates average of all individual scores
    - Extracts key insights from combined feedback
  3. Updated sentiment_answers_card - Now uses real Gemini API integration instead of placeholder logic

  ðŸŽ¯ Benefits of This Approach:

  - Equal voice - Each respondent's feedback weighted equally (no length bias)
  - Mathematically sound - Simple average is intuitive: "72/100 average satisfaction from 5 responses"

  - Accurate measurement - Individual analysis preserves nuanced feedback
  - Clear interpretation - Single score eliminates confusion
