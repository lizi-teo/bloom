You are a highly skilled software developer and are being tasked with creating a new Atom editor package.

Package Name: Feedback-GIFs

Core Functionality:
The purpose of this package is to provide a real-time, visual representation of sentiment or emotional keywords. It should receive a plain text string (representing user feedback) and then display a relevant GIF from the Giphy API. The core of this functionality must be a highly adaptable system that does not rely on a fixed set of sentiment categories.

Your Task:

System Architecture: Design and implement a robust package that can process a text input and infer a thematic or emotional keyword from it. The system should be able to handle a wide range of topics, such as 'frustrated,' 'delighted,' 'confused,' 'helpful,' or 'broken.' The goal is to translate user feedback into a relevant Giphy search query.

API Integration: Your implementation must connect to the Giphy API's search endpoint. The user should be able to input their own API key through a package setting.

Atom Package Logic: Implement the necessary Atom package commands and event listeners to allow a user to submit text to the system. The package should then call the Giphy API and display the retrieved GIF in a simple, non-intrusive view within the Atom editor.

Error Handling and Customization: Build in comprehensive error handling for situations where the API request fails or no relevant GIF is found. Include package settings that allow the user to customize the behavior of the system, such as a fallback GIF or a timeout for the display.

Questions by claude code
‚è∫ I'll help you create this Atom package for displaying sentiment-based GIFs. Let me clarify a few things to ensure I build exactly what you need:

  1. Text Input Method: How should users submit feedback text to the package? Should it be:
    - A command palette input?
    - A dedicated input field in a panel?
    - Selected text from the editor?
    - All of the above?
  2. GIF Display: Where/how should the GIF appear?
    - In a modal/popup?
    - In a side panel?
    - As a floating notification?
    - In a dedicated pane?
  3. Sentiment Analysis: For extracting keywords from feedback text, should I:
    - Use a simple keyword extraction approach?
    - Implement basic NLP for emotion detection?
    - Use an external sentiment analysis API?
    - Keep it lightweight with pattern matching?
  4. GIF Selection: When multiple GIFs are returned from Giphy, should the package:
    - Show the first result automatically?
    - Allow cycling through results?
    - Show a grid of options?
  5. Integration with Gemini Demo: You mentioned this will work with a Gemini AI sentiment demo. Should the package:
    - Accept sentiment scores/categories as input?
    - Export selected GIFs to another system?
    - Have specific integration points?

  Once you clarify these points, I'll build a comprehensive Atom package with all the features you need.
