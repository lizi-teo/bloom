put number of people given feedback in sessions list ui page
designa a solution for open ended answers - how might we get meaningful analysis of what people say. it might have to be something without a number. its just showing a answer, but it will be per person answer. 

probably retrieving patterns of repeated words like "slow" . go to Ai to get a sentiment value if i want. i will research on how this is done. 
how does one get a system to talk to an ai - you connect to the model API and then you send the text and ask it to review it for a sentiment 
then ask it to rate the sentiment on a scale of 0 to 100 with 0 being negative, 100 positive (assume a value for the sentiment, text to a value)
when the feedback form is saved - we send the text to the model API to analyse for sentiment. (i still want to see the users answers on a page though)


run a proper test if to see if it is really calculating number of people
