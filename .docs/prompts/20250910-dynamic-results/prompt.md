now that i have the gemini api installed in my flutter project, here is how i want to use it:
 
some questions in my templates are open-ended. these are used for capturing feedback from users.
 
i need a dart function that will take a string of user feedback as input. this function will then call the gemini api to perform a sentiment analysis on the text.
 
the ai should analyze the text and return a structured json response. the json must contain two key-value pairs:
 
1. sentiment_score: an integer value between 0 and 100, where 0 is the most negative and 100 is the most positive.
2. key_findings: a concise, comma-separated list of keywords and short phrases summarizing the main points.
 
the purpose is to make the results meaningful for improving my facilitation skills based on user feedback.
 
 look at the supabase tables relationships. look at the dynamic_results_page.dart and dyanmic_template_page.dart. can you tell me what is the best approach?

 let me know if you have questions
 
can you write the full dart code for this, including the necessary imports, api call, and json parsing?
 
please provide an example of how to call this function and handle the returned data.

I need to create a dynamic results page that displays data from a dynamic template form. The page will be built using specific components and will show both overall and question-specific averages.

Design and data analysis:

Analyze the Figma design file located at #fl to understand the visual layout and user experience.

Use mcp to examine the Supabase database schema, focusing on the results_answer table and its relationships with other tables, to understand how data is stored.

Component implementation:

lib/molecules/results_header.dart: This component must calculate and display the overall average. This is defined as the sum of all answers from all submitted forms divided by the total number of users who submitted the form.

lib/molecules/results_answers_card.dart: This component should display the average for a single question. The calculation is the sum of all answers for that specific question divided by the number of users who answered that particular question.

lib/molecules/decoration_tape.dart: This component needs to load an image relevant to the current section. The image url should be dynamically determined based on the section id."

create this dynamic results page in templates folder. ask me if you have questions
