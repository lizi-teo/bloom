> how do you know about andriod standards and carrying out the right audits?

‚è∫ Great question! My Android browser compatibility knowledge comes from several sources:

  Technical Foundation

  - Web Standards: Understanding of how mobile browsers (especially WebKit/Blink engines) render web content differently than desktop
  - Material Design Guidelines: Google's official design system specifies 44dp minimum touch targets, responsive breakpoints, and mobile-first principles
  - Flutter Web Architecture: Knowledge of how Flutter's web renderer interacts with mobile browsers and common performance bottlenecks

  Android Browser Ecosystem Knowledge

  - Browser Diversity: Android has multiple browsers (Chrome, Samsung Internet, Firefox) with different rendering behaviors
  - Hardware Variations: Android devices range from budget phones (360dp width) to flagship devices (412dp+ width) with different performance capabilities
  - System UI Differences: Android browsers handle address bars, navigation bars, and keyboard overlays differently than iOS

  Common Mobile Web Issues I'm Trained On

  - Viewport Problems: Incorrect meta tags causing zoom issues
  - Touch Target Sizing: Accessibility requirements for mobile interaction
  - Keyboard Handling: How mobile keyboards affect layout and scrolling
  - Performance Patterns: Heavy animations causing jank on mobile processors
  - SafeArea Issues: How different Android versions handle screen cutouts and system UI

  Code Pattern Recognition

  When I analyzed your code, I identified specific anti-patterns:
  - TickerProviderStateMixin - known to cause performance issues on mobile
  - Fixed height values - problematic when Android address bars collapse/expand
  - Missing resizeToAvoidBottomInset - classic mobile form problem
  - BouncingScrollPhysics - iOS behavior that feels wrong on Android

  What I DON'T Know

  - Real Device Testing: I can't actually test on devices
  - Latest Android Browser Updates: My knowledge has a cutoff date
  - Your Specific User Analytics: Which Android devices/browsers your users actually use
  - Current Performance Metrics: Your app's actual performance data

  Why This Audit is Valuable

  I'm essentially doing a "code review with mobile expertise" - identifying patterns that commonly cause problems based on established best practices and known browser limitations. Think of it as a preventive
  health check rather than a diagnosis of actual problems.

  Recommendation: Use this audit as a starting point, but validate the critical issues through actual device testing or browser developer tools mobile simulation.
