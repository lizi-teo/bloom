i am making a mobile icebreaker activity for team meetings or workshops where participants express how they're feeling today using a "sheep scale" instead of traditional numeric ratings.

The Concept:

Instead of asking "How do you feel on a scale of 1-10?", we use 9 different sheep images
Each sheep represents a different mood/energy level (from tired/overwhelmed to energetic/happy)
Users shake their phone to "tumble" through the sheep options randomly
The selected sheep reveals their mood with a fun description

User Flow:

User sees instruction: "On this sheep scale, how do you feel today?"
User shakes their device
Sheep image tumbles around the screen with physics animation
Image settles in a random position with a bounce
App reveals the mood description (e.g., "You're feeling like a fluffy cloud today - calm and dreamy!")
Optional: Show other participants' sheep choices in a group view

Why Sheep?

More engaging than numbers
Removes pressure of "rating" yourself
Creates conversation starters
Adds humor and lightness to check-ins
The "woolly" theme is inherently cozy and non-threatening

Technical Goals:

Smooth shake detection
Satisfying physics-based tumbling animation
Mobile-first responsive design
Works reliably across devices/browsers

This icebreaker helps facilitators gauge group energy while creating a fun, memorable moment that gets people talking and laughing together.
