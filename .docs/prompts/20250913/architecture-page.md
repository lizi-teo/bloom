there's also the problem of the responsive layout wrapper when we click on different items in the navigation drawer, it doesn't change the content within a container on the right of the drawer, but rather the 
  whole page. e.g. if i go create page, it reloads both responsive layout wrapper and the content on the right

⏺ You're absolutely right - this is a critical navigation architecture issue. The current implementation treats each navigation item as a separate page that recreates the entire ResponsiveLayoutWrapper, when it
   should maintain the wrapper and only update the content area.

  Current Problem Analysis

  Current Flow:
  1. User clicks "Create session" in navigation
  2. Navigator.push() creates entirely new page with new ResponsiveLayoutWrapper
  3. Both sidebar and content area are recreated
  4. No persistent navigation state

  Expected Flow (SPA-like):
  1. User clicks navigation item
  2. Only content area updates
  3. Sidebar stays persistent and maintains state
  4. Navigation state reflects current content

  Root Cause

  The issue is in responsive_layout_wrapper.dart:159-167 and similar navigation handlers - they use Navigator.push() which creates new pages instead of updating content in place.

  onTap: () {
    Navigator.push(  // ❌ This recreates entire page
      context,
      MaterialPageRoute(
        builder: (context) => const SessionCreateScreen(),
      ),
    );
  },

  Solution Architecture

  The dashboard should follow a Master-Detail or Shell Navigation pattern where:

  1. Shell Container (ResponsiveLayoutWrapper) stays persistent
  2. Content Area updates based on navigation state
  3. Navigation State managed at app level (Provider/Riverpod)
  4. URL/Routing reflects current content for web

  This aligns with the #pages guide's recommendation for adaptive navigation and follows modern web app patterns.

  Would you like me to create a plan to refactor this into proper shell navigation architecture?
