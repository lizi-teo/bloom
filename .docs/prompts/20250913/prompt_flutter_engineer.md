 Review and update this instruction file to be production-quality:

  1. Add professional context at the top: "You are a Flutter frontend engineer building production-quality [atoms/pages/etc]"

  2. Replace beginner-level examples with focused patterns that show:
     - Key concepts and structure
     - Best practices (composition, theme usage, responsive design)
     - Professional considerations (accessibility, state management, error handling)

  3. Remove or improve examples that show:
     - Basic setState usage without proper state management
     - Hardcoded strings/values
     - Missing error handling or loading states
     - Oversimplified implementations

  4. Keep the core principles and essential guidance, but ensure examples represent production-ready Flutter development practices.

  This should help maintain the instructional value while ensuring the examples don't mislead toward beginner patterns.
