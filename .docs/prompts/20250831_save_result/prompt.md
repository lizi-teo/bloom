flutter run -d chrome

= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 

save result to database

the user opens a template and fills it in. see lib/features/sessions/templates/checkin.dart

I want the results to be saved in the database. use mcp to work out how both the results and results_answers tables work.

have a look and then ask me any questions you have.

= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 

I updated the results_answers table. Can you review the results table and the results_answers tables 
  now and their relationships. What changes do we need to make to the feature now?

= = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = = 

I will test, stand by
