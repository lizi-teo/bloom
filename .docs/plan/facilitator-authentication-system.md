# Facilitator Authentication System Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for adding facilitator authentication to the Bloom app while preserving the existing zero-friction participant experience through shareable URLs and QR codes.

## Core Architecture: Route-Based Authentication

### Key Principle: Smart Route Detection
Instead of forcing users to choose their role, we automatically detect user type based on URL patterns:

- **Participant Routes**: `/session/*` → No authentication required
- **Facilitator Routes**: `/`, `/dashboard`, `/sessions/*`, `/create` → Authentication required
- **Demo Route**: `/demo` → Preserved for development/testing

## Current System Analysis

### What Exists Today
- ✅ **Participant Access**: Shareable URLs with session codes (`/session/ABC123`)
- ✅ **QR Code Generation**: Creates direct links to session participation
- ✅ **Session Management**: Full CRUD operations for sessions
- ✅ **Supabase Integration**: Backend infrastructure ready for authentication
- ✅ **Dynamic Routing**: Handles both session IDs and codes

### What Needs to Change
- 🔄 **Home Page**: Convert from demo page to facilitator dashboard/login
- 🔄 **Session Ownership**: Link sessions to authenticated facilitators
- 🔄 **Route Protection**: Add authentication checks for facilitator routes
- ➕ **Demo Page**: New route to preserve existing demo functionality

## User Flow Design

### Participant Flow (Zero Friction - No Changes)
```
QR Code Scan → /session/ABC123 → Session Template → Submit Feedback
     ↓              ↓                    ↓              ↓
   📱 Scan      Direct Access     No Auth Required   Complete
```

### Facilitator Flow (New Authentication)
```
App Access → / → Login Check → Dashboard → Create/Manage Sessions
    ↓        ↓        ↓           ↓              ↓
   🌐 URL   Login   Auth Gate   Secure Area   Full Access
```

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Authentication Infrastructure ✅ COMPLETED
**Goal**: Set up the foundation for user authentication

#### 1.1 Authentication Service ✅
- **File**: `lib/core/services/auth_service.dart`
- **Purpose**: The "translator" between our app and Supabase's authentication
- **What it does for users**:
  - Handles sign up with email/password
  - Handles login with email/password
  - Manages logout
  - Sends password reset emails
  - Gets user information (name, email, etc.)
- **Designer-friendly explanation**: Think of this as the "authentication manager" - it handles all the behind-the-scenes authentication work so other parts of the app don't need to worry about the technical details.

#### 1.2 Auth State Management ✅
- **File**: `lib/core/providers/auth_provider.dart`
- **Purpose**: Keeps track of whether someone is logged in across the entire app
- **What it does for users**:
  - Knows if a user is currently logged in
  - Updates all parts of the app when login status changes
  - Shows loading spinners while checking login status
  - Provides user info to any screen that needs it
- **Designer-friendly explanation**: This is like the app's "memory" for login status. When you log in on one screen, this makes sure every other screen knows you're logged in instantly.

#### 1.3 Login Screen ✅
- **File**: `lib/features/auth/screens/login_screen.dart`
- **Purpose**: The beautiful login/signup interface facilitators will see
- **Design features**:
  - Matches your session create screen design exactly (same colors, fonts, spacing)
  - Responsive design (works on mobile, tablet, desktop)
  - Toggle between "Sign In" and "Sign Up" modes
  - Password visibility toggle (eye icon)
  - Form validation with helpful error messages
  - "Forgot password?" dialog
  - Helpful hint for participants: "Have a session link? No account needed!"
- **Designer-friendly explanation**: This is the visual interface facilitators will interact with. I copied all the design patterns from your session create screen so it feels consistent.

#### 1.4 Auth Wrapper Widget ✅
- **File**: `lib/core/widgets/auth_wrapper.dart`
- **Purpose**: The "bouncer" that decides who can access what parts of the app
- **What it does**:
  - **Smart route detection**: Automatically knows which URLs need login
  - **Participant routes** (`/session/ABC123`): Always allows access (no login required)
  - **Facilitator routes** (`/`, `/dashboard`): Requires login
  - **Shows login screen**: If not logged in and trying to access facilitator areas
  - **Loading screen**: Beautiful branded loading screen while checking login status
- **Designer-friendly explanation**: This is like having an automatic security guard that knows the difference between participants (who get free access via QR codes) and facilitators (who need accounts). It never bothers participants but always protects facilitator areas.

- **Changes Applied**:
  - ✅ Converted `facilitator_id` column from `bigint` to `uuid`
  - ✅ Added foreign key constraint to `auth.users(id)`
  - ✅ Enabled Row Level Security (RLS) on sessions table
  - ✅ Created RLS policies for session ownership and participant access

**Final SQL Applied**:
```sql
-- Convert facilitator_id column type and add proper foreign key
ALTER TABLE sessions 
DROP CONSTRAINT IF EXISTS sessions_facilitator_id_fkey;

ALTER TABLE sessions 
ALTER COLUMN facilitator_id TYPE UUID USING NULL;

ALTER TABLE sessions 
ADD CONSTRAINT sessions_facilitator_id_fkey 
FOREIGN KEY (facilitator_id) REFERENCES auth.users(id);

-- Enable RLS and create policies
ALTER TABLE sessions ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Allow authenticated users to manage sessions" 
ON sessions FOR ALL
USING (auth.role() = 'authenticated')
WITH CHECK (auth.role() = 'authenticated');

CREATE POLICY "Public can access sessions by code" 
ON sessions FOR SELECT
USING (session_code IS NOT NULL);
```

#### 3.2 Session Service Updates ✅
