  1. Replace verbose examples with simple ones - Show minimal organism that just composes molecules
  2. Remove the second complex example - One simple example is enough
  3. Simplify rules to core principles - Focus on "compose molecules" not implementation details
  4. Update checklist to be practical - Remove verbose validation steps
