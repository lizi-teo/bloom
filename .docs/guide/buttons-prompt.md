  🎯 How to Use Built-in Material 3 Buttons:

  Just tell me what button you want and where, using these patterns:

  Primary Actions (FilledButton)

  "Add a FilledButton that says 'Save Changes' to the profile screen"
  "Create a primary button for submitting the form"
  "I need a FilledButton with 'Download Report' text"

  Secondary Actions (OutlinedButton)

  "Add an OutlinedButton that says 'Cancel' next to the save button"
  "Create a secondary button for 'View Details'"
  "I need an outlined button with 'Skip for now' text"

  Tertiary Actions (TextButton)

  "Add a TextButton that says 'Forgot Password?' below the login form"
  "Create a text button for 'Learn More'"
  "I need a simple text button with 'Edit' text"

  Icon Buttons

  "Add a FilledButton.icon with a download icon and 'Export' text"
  "Create an icon button with the add icon and 'Add Item' text"
  "I need an outlined button with edit icon and 'Edit Profile' text"

  🎨 What You Get Automatically:

  When you ask for these buttons, they automatically come with:
  - ✅ Your Figma design styling (colors, fonts, spacing)
  - ✅ Proper accessibility (screen reader support, touch targets)
  - ✅ Material 3 interactions (hover, focus, pressed states)
  - ✅ Theme support (works in light/dark mode)
  - ✅ Loading states support

  📝 Example Requests:

  Instead of saying: "Create a custom button component"

  Say: "Add a FilledButton that says 'Create Session' to the form"
  or
  Say: "I need an OutlinedButton with 'Cancel' text next to the submit button"

  The built-in buttons will automatically use all your design tokens and Figma styling! No custom components needed. 🎉
