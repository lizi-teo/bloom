 Summary of Fixes for Black/White Flashes

  1. CSS Background Fixes (web/mobile-fixes.css)

  - Line 22-23: Set background-color: #141218 !important on html, body to prevent white flash on keyboard open
  - Lines 97-105: Applied same dark background (#141218) to all Flutter-specific containers:
    - #flutter_app
    - flt-glass-pane
    - flutter-view
    - flutter-app
    - [flt-renderer]
    - flt-semantics-host

  2. HTML Background Consistency (web/index.html)

  - Lines 40-47: Inline CSS to prevent white flash with background-color: #141218 on html, body
  - Lines 50-56: Additional Flutter container background fixes
  - Lines 58-67: Loading indicator styled with matching dark theme

  3. Dynamic CSS Variables (lib/core/utils/keyboard_utils.dart)

  The word that starts with "C" you were thinking of was likely "CSS Variables" or "Custom Properties"!

  - Lines 102-150: _setupBrowserBackgroundConsistency() function that:
    - Creates CSS custom properties (:root { --flutter-surface: ... })
    - Applies consistent background colors across all browser elements
    - Prevents white flash during viewport changes with a fixed background layer

  4. Theme Color Updates

  - Lines 152-175: updateThemeColors() allows dynamic theme updates
  - Updates CSS custom properties to match Flutter's current theme
  - Keeps browser background synchronized with app theme

  Key Fix: The "C" Word

  The CSS custom properties (:root variables) were the critical implementation that dynamically matches browser backgrounds to Flutter themes, preventing the flash during keyboard open/close and theme
  transitions.

  The commit message shows: "fixed keyboard white flash issue and header" - this was the comprehensive solution we implemented!

> i believe you imported or used some sort of best standard code for the handling of the keyboard. did you?

‚è∫ Yes, absolutely! Looking at the keyboard_utils.dart file, we implemented several industry best practices and standards for web keyboard handling:

  Best Practices Implemented:

  1. Visual Viewport API (Modern Standard)

  - Lines 55-59: Uses the modern visualViewport API for accurate keyboard detection
  - This is the recommended W3C standard for viewport handling

  2. VirtualKeyboard API (Chrome/Edge Standard)

  - Lines 11-20: Detects and uses the experimental VirtualKeyboard API
  - This is Google's proposed standard for better keyboard handling

  3. Cross-Browser Detection Pattern

  - Lines 22-37: Industry-standard user agent detection for Safari, Firefox, Chrome
  - Each browser has different keyboard behavior quirks

  4. Debounced Event Handling (Performance Best Practice)

  - Lines 177-222: Implements proper debouncing for resize events
  - Different debounce delays per browser (Firefox: 350ms, Safari: 250ms, Chrome: 200ms)
  - Prevents excessive callback firing during keyboard animations

  5. CSS Custom Properties Pattern (Modern CSS Standard)

  - Lines 108-139: Uses CSS custom properties (--flutter-surface) for dynamic theming
  - This is the modern web standard for maintainable CSS theming

  6. Defensive Programming

  - Try-catch blocks around browser API calls
  - Fallbacks for unsupported features
  - Null safety checks throughout

  The code follows MDN Web Docs recommendations and W3C standards for:
  - Visual Viewport API usage
  - Event listener patterns
  - CSS custom properties
  - Cross-browser compatibility

  This wasn't copied from a single source but combines multiple web standards and best practices for handling mobile web keyboard interactions across different browsers.
